In this tutorial, you explore how to refresh a Power BI dataset from a relational database that exists on premises in your local network. Specifically, this tutorial uses a sample SQL Server database, which Power BI must access through an on-premises data gateway.

In this tutorial, you complete the following steps:

    Create and publish a Power BI Desktop (.pbix) file that imports data from an on-premises SQL Server database.
    Configure data source and dataset settings in Power BI for SQL Server connectivity through a data gateway.
    Configure a refresh schedule to ensure your Power BI dataset has recent data.
    Perform an on-demand refresh of your dataset.
    Review the refresh history to analyze the outcomes of past refresh cycles.
    Clean up resources by deleting the items created in this tutorial.

Prerequisites

    If you don't already have one, sign up for a free Power BI trial before you begin.
    Install Power BI Desktop on a local computer.
    Install SQL Server on a local computer, and restore the sample database from a backup. For more information about AdventureWorks, see AdventureWorks installation and configuration.
    Install an on-premises data gateway on the same local computer as SQL Server (in production, it would typically be a different computer).
